This repository contains the source code behind the paper ["Systematic identification of proteins that elicit drug side effects"](http://msb.embopress.org/content/9/1/663.abstract). The Makefile was linked in a directory in my data folder. 

The present source code will not enable you to simply type "make" and obtain the full results of the paper. Nonetheless, it is [a start](http://ivory.idyll.org/blog/2014-myths-of-computational-reproducibility.html) for reproducing the intermediate results. 

Thanks to H.T. for trying to reproduce my results solely from the paper, which was doomed to failure.
